## ✅ Completed Tasks

---

### 🟢 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

- Dataset: **Iris Flower Dataset**
- Tools: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- Performed data inspection and created visualizations (scatter plot, histogram, box plot)
- Gained insights into feature relationships and data distribution

---

### 🟢 Task 2: Predict Future Stock Prices (Short-Term)

- Used historical Apple stock data (offline CSV)
- Features used: Open, High, Low, Volume
- Target: Predict the **next day’s closing price**
- Model: **Linear Regression**
- Evaluated using Mean Squared Error and plotted real vs predicted prices

---

### 🟢 Task 5: Mental Health Support Chatbot (Offline, Rule-Based)

- Objective: Build a chatbot for emotional support using empathetic responses
- Technology: **100% Offline**, no external packages
- Logic: Keyword-based detection (`sad`, `anxious`, `lonely`, etc.)
- Outcome: Safe, calming user interaction with no API dependencies

---

### 🟢 Task 6: House Price Prediction

- Dataset: **California Housing Dataset** (loaded from GitHub)
- Features included income, rooms, population, location
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model
- Evaluated using **MAE** and **RMSE**
- Visualized actual vs predicted house prices

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Jupyter Notebook (local)
- Python 3 (Anaconda)
- pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn
- No API keys, GPU, or internet access required
